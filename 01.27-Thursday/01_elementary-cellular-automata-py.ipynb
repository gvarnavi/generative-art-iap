    "# Cellular automata in 1D\n",
    "A cellular automaton is a system of interacting cells on a grid whose future state depends on the states of neighboring cells according to a pre-defined rule. Let's start by looking at cellular automata in one dimension. The following represents a sequence of cells:\n",

    "\n",
    "The state of each cell is represented by a binary value, and in 1D, each cell has two neighbors. Thus, we can look at the \"code\" formed by considering a cell and its two neighbors in the order left, center, right (LCR).\n",

    "This binary triplet, such as 011 in the example shown, can be thought of as a unique identifier for that specific neighbor state configuration. We can also convert the representation of the code from binary to decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our codes are only 3 digits long in binary, how many possible combinations are there? There are $2\\times2\\times2=8$ possibilities. Thus, our rules for the evolution of cellular automata must prescribe an outcome for each of the 8 possible configurations we can observe. These rules were formalized and extensively studied by Wolfram. Each rule is expressed as an 8-bit binary string, such as the example Rule 30 below:\n",
