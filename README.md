# Generative Art Workshop (IAP 2021)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://gke2.mybinder.org/v2/gh/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap-binder-env/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fgvarnavi%252Fgenerative-art-iap%26urlpath%3Dtree%252Fgenerative-art-iap%252F%26branch%3Dmaster)  
This is the git repository of the generative art workshop, taught by Jovana Andrejevic, Nina Andrejevic, and George Varnavides, in IAP 2021. This is the fourth iteration of the generative art workshop taught over IAP by the instructors (previously taught in 2017 and 2018 with Emma Vargo, and in 2020 with Amina Matt). We are indebted to Emma and Amina for some of the original content we'll use in the workshop.

## Communication
There are three main ways in which we'll communicate for this class.
* [Github repository](https://github.com/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap): To access the notebooks and files used in class
* [Generative Art 2021 Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/generativeart2021/shared_invite/zt-knj01qsy-5UvufhL4cBrjFEm6o9A~_g): To communicate with the instructors and each other (primary means of communication)
* [generative-art-2021@mit.edu Mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/generative-art-2021): To communicate class-wide announcements (will be used very sparsely)

## Programming Languages
While there are many great programming and scripting languages to do generative art with, the class will be taught using Python and the Wolfram Language. This choice is partly due to the following reasons (aside from the instructors' familiarity with these languages):
1. Ease of prototyping (and learning) code
2. Built-in (high-level) visualization functions
3. The interactive Notebook format compliments the way we prototype and think of generative art

This last point also motivates the use of Jupyter notebooks in particular. We'll use [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) to share fully-executable notebooks with both Python and Wolfram Language kernels.

Note that we'll try and provide *most* of the content in both languages; while we'll alternate presenting certain concepts in Mathematica and others in Python, you will have the corresponding notebook in the other language for reference.

### Installation instructions
You shouldn't need to install anything to follow-along! 
Just follow the link to [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://gke2.mybinder.org/v2/gh/gvarnavi/generative-art-iap-binder-env/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fgvarnavi%252Fgenerative-art-iap%26urlpath%3Dtree%252Fgenerative-art-iap%252F%26branch%3Dmaster) (you might have to wait a bit for instance to launch).  
If you prefer to clone the repository and follow-along locally, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/WolframResearch/WolframLanguageForJupyter) to set up a Wolfram Engine kernel with jupyter.
