    "Space-filling curves are a type of fractal that can fill the 2D plane. Notably, space-filling curves have finite area, but infinite length. Here we will look at a particular type of space-filling curve, the Hilbert curve, and see how we can use it to make continuous line drawings. The figure below illustrates the first four levels of the Hilbert curve on a regular grid.\n",
